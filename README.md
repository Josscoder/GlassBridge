This plugin replicates the **Glass Bridge** minigame from *Squid Game* in **PocketMine-MP**! 💀 Players must choose the right glass panes to survive or fall to their doom.

⚙️ **Developer-Friendly Code** – Learn how to make glass logic.

🚫 **Not for Server Owners** – This plugin is a coding example, not a ready-to-use minigame.

📌 Use it to study, modify, and create your own version!
